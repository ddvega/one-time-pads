# one_time_pads
#### Assignment 3 - David Vega 8/2/20

```
In this assignment, you will be creating five small programs that encrypt 
and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. These programs will 
combine the multi-processing code you have been learning with socket-based 
inter-process communication. Your programs will also be accessible from the 
command line using standard Unix features like input/output redirection, and
job control. Finally, you will write a short compilation script.
```

To test the program please do the following. 

1. unzip vegada_assignment3.zip
2. chmod +x compileall p3gradingscript
3. compileall
4. p3gradingscript port1 port2 > mytestresults 2>&1
